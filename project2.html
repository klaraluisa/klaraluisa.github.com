                <h3>Project</h3>
                <p>For this project I worked within a team and designed in the context of usage a set of disposable plates, based on a given material and production process. The modular plate can be cut and have different shapes, and therefore allows to serve a big variety of different meals in a plate which can be manufactured in one mould.

                <h3>Brief</h3>
                <p>The summer course Sustainable Innovation into Practice took place in August 2018 in the sustainable innovation hub DORP, which is part of the festival Welcome to the Village in Leeuwaarden. Together with a group of other technical students I worked 2 weeks intensively on the festival site on a project for  the dutch company <a href=" http://www.biopackpackaging.com" target="_blank">BioPack</a>, which produces biodegradable, food safe packaging from cellulose fibres.
<br>
The design brief came from both the festival organisation and from BioPack. The festival aims to be more sustainable by only having one waste stream in the future, which should be completely compostable. Therefore it was the question if it is possible to design a range of disposables which can be locally produced by BioPack and substitute all other (not biodegradable) disposables, the food trucks currently use on the festival.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
In the beginning it was important to understand the production process and advantages and limitations of it, for which we visited BioPack's production facilities. Next to this we did extensive interviews with food trucks, festival visitors and the festival organisation, which helped us understand their requirements and preferences. Working onsite at the festival made us completely immerse in the context and quickly come up with ideas. We made many models of our designs to directly evaluate them with the different people on the festival.

            <img src="images/project2/project2_4-features.jpg" style="width:100%">
            <div class="text">
                <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>The result was a modular plate, consisting of several cavities of different sizes, but same depth. The plate can be used as a whole to for example nicely serve a three course menu, divided into the smaller bowls. One cavity can be alternatively used to put a drink and this way it is possible to easily carry the plate with one hand or eat standing. In case a food truck serves rather smaller portions or snacks, the plate can be split into individual smaller bowls.
<br> The irregular and unusual shape is chosen to ensure that each bowl separately is perceived as an attractive plate, but still be coherent as a whole. Not having a round or rectangular plate also makes people forget their expectations about whether a portion for example looks too small in a plate.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>The advantage of this design is that only one relatively cheap mold is needed, to create all the different types of plates for food trucks at festivals. This way it is possible that a rather small and local company can produce the plates with overseeable investments. By making locally produced biodegradable plates cheaper, and more attractive for food trucks and their customers, they become a serious alternative to plastic disposables or other biodegradable disposables imported from overseas. Like this waste on festivals can be heavily reduced and sustainable solutions become more accessible.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>I developed and tested the design together with my group mates Charlotte, Merlijn and Esther. It was an intense project, where we worked everyday until late. It was amazing to see what we could achieve in this short time. I took part in all the different activities of this project, but focused on the manufacturing, making the CAD design, 3d printing the models and conducting user tests. 
<br>
This project resulted in a job for me and I continue working as freelancer for BioPack, redesigning packaging for their clients so it can be efficiently produced by BioPack.
