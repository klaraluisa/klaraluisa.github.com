        <h2>Hood <span>Helmet</span></h2>
        <p>
            Final Bachelor project for Edwin vd Saar Foundation. 
<br>
		Concept development of a foldable bike helmet which is integrated in the hood of a rain jacket, 
<br>
so you automatically wear it when you need it most.

                <h3>Project</h3>
                <p>For this design project I applied an holistic approach to make biking more safe and attractive. The result was a convenient, foldable helmet you are motivated to wear when you need it the most. Since most accidents happen with bad weather, it made sense to me to integrate the helmet in the hood of rain jackets, so you wear it for the comfort and you can take the added safety as a bonus.
<br>
My project was selected as one of the best projects of my year during the final exhibition and also was exhibited during the faculty's open day as an example project. Furthermore I got the chance to present my concept at <a href="https://egghelmets.com/" target="_blank">EggHelmets</a> to potentially further develop and launch the design together.

                <h3>Brief</h3>
                <p>My final bachelor project was initiated by the <a href=" https://www.edwinvandersarfoundation.nl/" target="_blank">Edwin van der Saar Foundation</a> and I worked on it independently for a duration of 10 weeks, finishing in july 2017 with a final grade of 8.5.  
<br>
The design brief was to motivate children to move more, while increasing the safety of it. I choose the context of biking to school, especially when the weather is bad, because I saw a big potential there.

            <div class="text"> <h3>Process</h3>
             <p>I started with understanding the user and why it is rare for people in The Netherlands to wear a helmet. After coming up with the idea of integrating a foldable helmet in the hood of a rain jacket, I did an extended market analysis, studying existing products, patents and concepts. I developed a wide range of ideas and further defined and tested a few working principles with simple models, from which I then developed my final concept.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <h3>Concept</h3>
             <p>The final concept consists of 3 layers: 
<br>outside the hood, which is fixed to the collar of the rain jacket and is made of cut-resistant Kevlar©
<br>inside a thin and elastic fabric
<br>and in between the lightweight and shock damping layer of folded PP, which perfectly takes the shape of your head and can be compactly folded and bent around the collar.

            <img src="images/project1/project1_5-advantages.jpg" style="width:100%">
             <div class="text">
                <h3>Design</h3>
             <p>The chin straps make sure the helmet stays in place in case of a hit. They also pull the hood close to your face, to provide a wide field of view, and can be used to quickly remove the helmet from the collar to unfold it. The helmet hood can be easily attached to different types of jackets.
<br>The integration of the helmet in the rain jacket hood makes helmets more accepted and attractive, not only making it more safe for kids to always bike to school, but the design can be also suitable for other contexts of use, such as outdoor sports.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
             <p>My final bachelor project was a big challenge, since it was my first extended design project I conducted completely individually and I could freely define my approach. I succeeded in applying a variety of different design methods and skills, which I learned during my studies and could show that I am able complete a design process, from problem analysis to final design concept. Also I could demonstrate my project planning competences and finished the project well in time, while still taking the most out of it. By writing my final report and giving the presentation in Dutch, I could proof that I reached an advanced language level after 3.5 years of learning Dutch.
