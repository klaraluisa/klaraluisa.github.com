            <h1>
                Hi! My name is Klara Kohler</h1>


            <br>

            <p>
I am a second year master student in Integrated Product Design at TU Delft, graduating in August 2019. I am coming from Germany and live now in The Netherlands for 5 years. I am an active person, who loves nature, which is reflected in my passion for outdoor activities, gardening, and sustainable design. I like cultures and languages and enjoy working in a diverse team and travel and explore new places. As designer I want to create meaningful products, which emphasize the interaction between people and nature. By engaging people to experience nature I want to establish awareness for our environment in a positive way. Considering the user and the context, I like to solve a problem and design for sustainability, from the materialisation and production throughout the complete life cycle of a product. I enjoy the translation of an idea into a physical product, creating tangible prototypes and making it real. Good design means for me integration and simplification, making good use of technology and resources.
                I feel confident building things, and have experience with metal working, rapid prototyping and DIY. I think very practical and like to make concepts tangible. I am good at doing research, and can well present with a good argumentation and a coherent story. I have a critical mindset and I work goal oriented, which also makes me good with planning. I know the design process well and am good in team work, also with a multidisciplinary and international team. I speak fluently German, English, Dutch, and basic French and Spanish. I am flexible, open-minded and my curiosity makes me motivated and enthusiastic for a project.
